## About The Project

I began this project with the goal of solving a real-world issue. Specifically, my father and his colleagues work as truck drivers for a company that still relies on a paper-based system to keep track of their work hours and routes. Initially, I created an Excel spreadsheet for them that included statistical calculations, but as I gained more knowledge and experience, I decided to develop a website instead.
