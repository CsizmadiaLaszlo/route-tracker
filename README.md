## About The Project

I began this project with the goal of solving a real-world issue. Specifically, my father and his colleagues work as truck drivers for a company that still relies on a paper-based system to keep track of their work hours and routes. Initially, I created an Excel spreadsheet for them that included statistical calculations, but as I gained more knowledge and experience, I decided to develop a website instead.

## Hosting

Great news! The project is already hosted on Heroku and can be accessed at https://routetracker.herokuapp.com/. However, it's worth noting that both the backend and frontend are currently hosted on Heroku Eco, which means that the website is not always active it may be in a sleeping stage. Please be patient, as the system may need some time to wake up. Thank you for your interest, and happy exploring!
