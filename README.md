## About The Project

This is a pet project to solve a real-life problem. My father and his friends work as truck drivers, and the company still uses a paper-based system to track working hours and routes. For this project, I first created an Excel spreadsheet that even calculates statistics for them, but with my new knowledge, I decided to create a website for them.
